# ✡ A Bar Mitzvah programme in LaTeX
A simple template for a small Bar Mitzvah programme (or brochure or order of service or pamphlet—lots of words work) in `LaTeX`, based on one I created for my youngest brother's Bar Mitzvah.  Usage is fairly straightforward, and two libre Hebrew fonts are included.  Dimensions are set to take up one half of letter paper, but can easily be altered.
