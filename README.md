# ✡ A Bar Mitzvah programme in LaTeX
A simple template for a small Bar Mitzvah programme (or brochure or order of service or pamphlet—lots of words work) in LaTeX, based on one I created for my youngest brother's Bar Mitzvah.  Usage is fairly straightforward, and two libre Hebrew fonts are included.

A picture of the completed programme:
